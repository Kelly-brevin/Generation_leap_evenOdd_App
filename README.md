# Generation_leap_evenOdd_App

This is a simple app that allows the user to select an action based on the number input. The user can check whether the number is even or odd, whether the input is a leap year or not and what generation does that year. The result is then displayed in a modal.
I created this simple app to practice the javascript basics, with an emphasis on DOM manipulation and modals.
